            <p class="paragraph">I find the work itself coarse and brutish, but none the less nessacary for an evenings warmth. Although best enjoyed with some fine chewing tobacco and a bit of brandy.
                Often a fire in the mornings is nice with my coffee but can be difficult to justify on days at work or in the studio. 
                It is honest work though, with an instant sense of gratification. Anyways during my laboring hours I could not get my mind around Schrodinger's Cat. 
                If quantum superposition says particles can be in multiple places at once, maybe even EVERY place at once..Then why is it that my mailbox is still there everytime I walk by it?
                Why is it not in another one of it many positions it could be in? Would I know what a mailbox was, if it wasn't there all of a sudden?
                Each time I walk around my hedge row to the path by the road I pass right by it wondering if it will be always there, but always knowing "of course it's still there. I have three letters I am expecting today." 
                <br>
                <br>
                This is how I get my mind off the chore of my wanting of warmth. I did manage to beat Hughbert in chess today.

            <p class="paragraph">He walked into the corner market and cafe this past weekend. I was there reading and journaling when Hugh approached me. He asked to join and I obliged.
                We made small talk as he started to organize the chess pieces on the board as I realized my reading and jounaling time was going to have to wait. 
                In the middle of his small talk baratement he asked me how often I read my Bible. Still a bit dazed from being interupted and talked at I answered, "When I want to read the words of the lives and desicions made many years ago."
                So I returned the favor and asked how often he read his. Sharp and too the point he responded "4-5 times a week as a man of integrity."
                I lost the game due to a weak attack that was prematurely played.  The question he proposed to me about this common ritualistic behavoir lingered. The Bible has some of the oldest and most manupulative texts in all of history.
                Wars have been fought, childeren have died over mis-interpureted words. What events led to this book, and these particular stories, giving such a rise of passion and martyrdom. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is very interesting as well to think that this book has been passed through billions of hands accross every continent. But I still find it on the shelf next to other books seemingly just like it. I guess it's just a book to me.
