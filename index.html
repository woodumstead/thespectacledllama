            <p class="paragraph">I find the work itself coarse and brutish, but non the less nessacery for an evenings warmth. Although best enjoyed with some fine chewing tobacco and a bit of brandy.
                Often a fire in the mornings is nice with my coffee but can be difficult to justify on days at work or in the studio. 
                It is honest work though, and an instant sense of gratification when seeing a days work accomplished. Anyways during my laboring hours I could not get my mind around the Schrodinger's Cat idea. 
                If quantum superposition says particles can be in multiple places at once, maybe even EVERY place at once..Then why is it that my mailbox is still there everytime I walk by it?
                Why is it not in another one of it many positions it could be in? Would I know that I ever had a mailbox if it wasn't there all of a sudden?
                Each time I walk around my hedge row to the path by the road I pass right by it wondering if it will be always there, but always knowing "of course it's still there. I have three letters I am expecting today." 
                <br>
                <br>
                This is how I get my mind off the chore of my wanting of warmth. I did manage to beat Hughbert in chess today.
