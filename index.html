            <p class="paragraph"> &#9823 â™Ÿ There is a birding group I have recently been allowing time for. I have been busy at the studio and lost track of the days. The birding group is set to leave for Landes de Gasconge forest tomorrow and my maps are outdated. 
                I had a colleague of mine explained to me, that Earth's magnetic field is held in position by a few things. Neighboring planets, its rotating axis, and a myriad of other reasons which I do not fully understand. 
                What I may see on my compass or how the graph or coordinates are oriented on a map has a small annual declination. Meaning that the magnetic poles are shifting. What is curious about magnets is that they don't have a lot of in-between, there are just two poles. 
                Moreover, the poles are at some unseen, possibly arbitrary, line with a strong distaste for the other. How far will the declination trend before a potentially violent flip? What does that mean for anything we hold value to?

            <p class="paragraph"> &#9823  He walked into the corner market and cafe this past weekend. I was there reading and journaling when Hugh approached me. He asked to join and I obliged. 
                We made small talk as he started to organize the chess pieces on the board I realized my reading and journaling time was going to have to wait.
                In the middle of his small talk beratement, he asked me how often I read my Bible. Still, a bit dazed from being interrupted and talked at I answered, "When I want to read the words of the lives and decisions made many years ago." 
                So I returned the favor and asked how often he read his. Sharp and to the point he responded "4-5 times a week as a man of integrity." I lost the game due to a weak attack that was prematurely played.
                The question he proposed to me about this common ritualistic behavior lingered. The Bible has some of the oldest and most manipulative texts in all of history. Wars have been fought, children have died over misinterpreted words. 
                What events led to this book, and these particular stories, giving such rise to passion and martyrdom?
 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is very interesting as well to think that this book has been passed through billions of hands across every continent. But I still find it on the shelf next to other books seemingly just like it.
